Controller Machine: the machine where Ansible is installed, responsible for running the provisioning on the servers you are managing
Inventory: an INI file that contains information about the servers you are managing
Playbook: the entry point for Ansible provisionings, where the automation is defined through tasks using YAML format
Task: a block that defines a single procedure to be executed, e.g.: install a package
Module: a module typically abstracts a system task, like dealing with packages or creating and changing files. Ansible has a multitude of built-in modules, but you can also create custom ones
Role: a pre-defined way for organizing playbooks and other files in order to facilitate sharing and reusing portions of a provisioning
Play: a provisioning executed from start to finish is called a play
Facts: global variables containing information about the system, like network interfaces or operating system
Handlers: used to trigger service status changes, like restarting or stopping a service
